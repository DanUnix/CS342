Description of game logic

square.java
-----------
I first created a square.java class file. This class contains data on a single square object. This includes a boolean value called isMine which is set if a square in the 2D-Array grid is set to be a mine in the game.java setMines() function. I also created a string called flag. This string status is to be changed when the user right clicks the button. It goes through 3 changes: " "(blank), "M"(Mine), and "?". I also created an integer called near. This integer is intially set to 0 on program start but is later incremented when checking to see if how many mines surround it at that location. 

The constructor for square.java intializes the boolean value isMine to false, sets the flag to empty string, and the integer near to 0.

The function RandomBoolean is not used in the real construction of the code as it was only a means of sanity checking to make sure the boolean value is changed. Instead of RandomBoolean, in game.java there is a setMines function which sets 10 mines randomly onto the grid. 

The function setFlag gets basically sets the flag of the current square when right clicked on as stated above.
